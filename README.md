Assignment: Fashion MNIST Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Visualizations

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using the Fashion MNIST dataset available in Keras. You will create visualizations, compile the model, and evaluate its performance on both training and validation sets. Finally, use the trained model to predict on the test data.
